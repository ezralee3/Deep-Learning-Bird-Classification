# Deep-Learning-Bird-Classification
This is my final project for my Deep Learning class, where I created an image classifier of birds utilizing transfer learning and convolutional neural networks. All the code is included along with the report and analyses. The images used in this project is from the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset.
